# KfWs Open Project Location Model
## About
Welcome! This is KfWs repository for storing the open project location model which can be used to collect project location sites and meta-information for international development projects, including those financed by KfW. 
The project location model comes in form of an Excel template which can be used to collect the data. 

**A guideline on how to collect this information is published and continously updated [here](https://openkfw.github.io/open-geodata-model/).**

## Available versions and versioning of the template. 
Please note, that the Excel template and the guidelines are living documents. We keep on advancing the model i.e. by extending the list of location types beyond those available in the IATI standard. 
You might therefore find different versions of the template in this repository over time. We are also working hard to provide the template in different languages. 

## Open Data Kit / KoboToolbox Templates
In addition to the Excel template named "Project_Location_Data_Template," we provide two other templates named "Project_Location_ODK_Template" for data collection using either [ODK](https://getodk.org/) or [KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/). Therefore, all three templates adhere to the same configuration, encompassing identical required data points, such as project number, location types, DAC codes etc.

## Some general remarks
The technical specifications as well as the sample Terms of Referencecan for collecting the data can be found in this repository. The information in the table of the page "Technical Notes" is also given as comments in the Excel template if you click on the cells. Most importantly make sure to use WGS 84 as the coordinate reference system when submitting locations in lat/long format. You might also collect proper geo-data in formats such as kml oder geojson (oder shapefile). If you send this information together with the template it might help to verify the coordinates in the template. In addition it will be very usefull in cases where a project location is better represented by line or polygon geometries (e.g. protected areas or transimission lines).
