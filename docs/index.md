# The KfW Geodata Model / Project Location Data Collection model

## What is the KfW Geodata Model? 
The KfW Geodata Model (= project location data collection model) is a data model to systematically collect location-specific information in projects supported by German financial cooperation in a structured way. The model is currently provided in Excel format (xlsx), a Kobo Toolbox version is under development. All basic data regarding project locations are to be collected there. In addition, it might be required to submit additional geospatial information in a “KML” format.

## For what purpose do you collect this information?
German Financial Cooperation uses structured geo-information to process project location datasets that help us report on the relevance, progress and impacts of our portfolio. We do geospatial analysis and create portfolio maps for the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and the German public who finances our joint projects with their taxpayer money. Your cooperation will ultimately help us to justify and leverage financial funds for international development.

## How can my project benefit from this?
You can ask your KfW project counterpart to provide you with the data that is generated by our geospatial analysis. In addition we provide our analysis tools as a free and open-source software library in R. Our package is able to automatically download, pre-process and analyze several open data-providers and generate statistics on climate, land-use, forests, ecosystems, water bodies, wildfires and many more.  


# KfW’s Project Location Data Collection and Management Approach

In this Section we explain the FC Geodata Model according to which project location data should be collected as well as technical requirements for the data collection. The goal is to inform KfW staff, Project Executing Agencies (PEAs), consultants, and other external stakeholders responsible for data collection as to the types of location data to be collected and in what form.

Our FC Geodata Model is mostly based on the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) standard. The IATI Standard is used by international development organizations and allows harmonization of FC project location data across heterogenous projects. The data to be collected are subject to minimum requirements in the form of mandatory fields, and there are optional fields flexibly usable for collecting site-specific information.

Furthermore, projects are able to store single location points (e.g., the location of one power plant site) or a larger number of project sites and features (e.g., 300 locations of buildings in different sectors within the framework of a decentralization project). In addition, project sites with larger areas and more complex geometries (e.g., polygons of forest protection areas) are supported as well.

Please note, that KfW does not publish any exact coordinates of its project locations. Location data collection in fragile and conflict contexts should be treated with extra diligence.

## General Notes on Geodata and Location Information

### What is a project location?

**A project location can consist of one or more features that are part of a financially supported activity where no further geographical discrimination regarding funding is possible.** An example of a single-feature project location is a financially supported hospital in a specific location. An example of a project location with multiple features is a group of adjacent agricultural plots under a financed irrigation plan that benefits all producers in that area. Another example is a set of protected areas jointly financed from a fund if, and only if, further geographical discrimination as to the allocation of funds to specific areas is not possible. If discrimination is possible, data for multiple project locations (such as protected areas) and their financial allocation have to be collected. KfW highly encourages increasing geographical discrimination of financial flows to specific project locations to the maximum possible, as this affords greater aid transparency and financial accountability.

### Difference between exact and approximate locations

For each project location there will be one exact[^1] or approximate geolocation data set. The exact geolocation designates the geographical end point of an international development assistance financial flow. Approximate locations should be used however, when no exact geoinformation is (yet) available, when it is not collected due to security reasons or when you want to indicate your target location to be an administrative unit area (details see below).

For exact locations, geographical data are to be collected with GPS tools and eventually edited in a Geographical Information System (GIS). Approximate locations should be given on administrative scales using the GADM database as a global standard.

[^1]: in the sense of the IATI- Standard

### When to collect project location information

KfW strongly encourages the PEA and/or consultant staff to collect exact or approximate geo-coordinates as early on as possible in the project cycle to increase the usage potential of such data throughout the entire project cycle. Ideally, data should be collected already during the project preparation phase, e.g., as part of the feasibility study.

If no exact locations can be determined at this stage, approximate location should be used and later be checked during the project appraisal and inception stages (including possible transformation from approximate to exact location information). During project implementation, data should be updated at least annually in project progress reviews, and in order to reflect potential changes in the geographical allocation of funds, which are common in Financial Cooperation projects.

### Geometrical characteristics of exact geo location information

'Exact[^1] locations' are measured via GPS devices, and geo-coordinates are to be collected as precisely as possible. For this purpose, three different geometry types can be used

1.  Point geometries (e.g., a well or a hospital)

2.  Line geometries (e.g., a road or transmission line)

3.  Polygon geometries/shapes (e.g., a protected area or agricultural
    plots)

All exact project locations have to be collected at first as a point geometry that represents a gateway to the project location, irrespective of the actual feature geometry (i.e., also for lines and polygons). This may be for example the center of a road, a village adjacent to agricultural plots or the administration building of a protected forest. If there is a line or polygon geometry and no gateway can be defined, the geometrical center (centroid) is to be used. This information is to be collected in an Excel template (xlsx) or a future open-source based geodata collection tool providing the geographical coordinates of the gateway point (more information to be provided in this repository.

In addition, line and polygon geometries have to be collected in KML[^2] format independently for each project site (details are given below in data formats and templates).

[^2]: KML (KMZ) is an open XML Standard for Points, Lines and Shapes. Officially named the OpenGIS KML Encoding Standard (OGC KML). It is maintained by the Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC). Other Geoformats (e.g., Shapefiles or Geojson) can usually be converted to KML in Standard Geographic Information System (GIS) Software such as ArcGIS or QGIS.

### When to use approximate geo location information

Approximate[^1] locations should be used when no exact geoinformation is available (yet), or when exact location information should not be collected or communicated, or when the target area is an administrative unit. The approximate location option should be chosen if one or more of the following circumstances apply:

-   an exact project location has not (yet) been specified or is not yet known -> then choose option: *approximate (yet unknown)*

-   an exact project location is not to be collected or communicated due to security reasons -> then choose option: *approximate (security)*   

-   the target location(s) is/are one or more administrative units, e.g. a district, a province or the entire country -> then choose option: *approximate (admin unit)*   

In all such cases, approximate location must be defined based on administrative units applying the [Global Aviation Data Management (GADM) standard](https://gadm.org/)\. GADM is used as a common standard for administrative units to afford harmonized and consistent collection of approximate locations. Details see below under "READ-ME". 


## Project Geodata Standard Formats and Templates


### Link to Project Location Data Collection Template 

**You can find the current version of the projection location data collection template [here](https://github.com/openkfw/open-geodata-model/blob/main/Project_Location_Data_Template_V02.xlsx).**

### Why do you use Excel? Why can’t I submit my information in a geospatial format altogether? 
The project location data collectiond model is used in all sectoral contexts where generally point locations may in most cases be sufficient and Excel can handle those cases using the “latitude” and “longitude” columns. In addition, Excel allows us to better control the information that is submitted, while also being widely distributed and able to be filled out offline. We are currently working on providing a form to be used in Kobo-Toolbox and  we are considering creating an open XML file which can be used in the future by our project partners to collect the data more easily by their staff or to create automated extracts from their own database systems while being compliant with the KfW project location data collection model.  


### Exact locations using the Excel Template (and potentially KML files)

As outlined above, all project locations should be collected using the above Excel template (or the respective Kobo Toolbox form currenly under development, which will be published in this repository) provided by KfW, which utilizes mostly predefined categories under the IATI standard and built-in selection methods facilitating clean data entry. The only difference to the IATI-standard is that the exising IATI list of location types has been expanded to cover all physical and immaterial location types required by international development. The geolocation is to be submitted in Excel with the geo-coordinates that can be obtained with a GPS tool. **All coordinates are to be collected using** **WGS 84**[^3] **as the coordinate reference system.** WGS 84 is the de-facto standard for web mapping applications. Geo-coordinates are to be provided in the decimal place format 00.00000 in the order LONG, LAT (using at least 5 digits after the separator).
[^3]: World Geodetic System 1984 (https://support.virtual-surveyor.com/en/support/solutions/articles/1000261351-what-is-wgs84\)

-   **For point locations** like buildings, filling out the exact GPS point location in the Excel template is sufficient. We estimate that about 90% of all project locations are point locations.

-   **For line and polygon geometries,** please provide additional geoinformation in the KML format, e.g. for lines or polygons (e.g. in the case your location covers a forest area or an administrative unit like a district as a whole). The gateway GPS point location is stored in Excel/Kobo. Multiple KML files should be submitted to KfW as .zip or .tar container. The data collector must ensure that the KfW staff responsible for uploading the data into the GeoApp are able to connect single KML files with project locations to the gateway points in Excel/Kobo. 
In the section ‘Location data’, under ‘Latitude’ and ‘Longitude’, fill in the coordinates of the locations centroid. Provide the information of the additional columns in this section. For each row entry with additional geolocation, indicate the filename of the KML file in which the associated geometry is stored.  An example of such a KML filename is "00345_Ouagadougou.kml". The column `Primary Key` is used to associate an activity described in the excel sheet with its corresponding geolocation. It is very important this field is filled correctly. For each distinct location the primary key is equivalent both in the excel sheet and the associated KML file. Use whole numbers (integers) to construct the primary key. Similar to point locations, make sure that the geoinformation is delivered in unprojected coordinates on the WGS84 reference ellipsoid in the order LAT,LONG ("EPSG:4326").
We follow this two-step approach for line and polygon geodata to ensure that all relevant metadata is collected in a clean way in Excel (or Kobo) while still being able to submit relevant geometry information in a common geo-standard. It is strongly encouraged to submit additional geometry information in KML for locations larger than 1000 m (line) or 500 m2 (shapes) wherever possible, to enable KfW to see the spatial delimitation of our projects (e.g., a transmission line or the boundaries of a protected area). **KML files are also to be submitted using** **WGS 84 as the coordinate reference system.** The WG S84 datum is also used by OpenStreetMaps and Google Maps. The complete specification for OGC KML can be found [here](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml/).

It is strongly encouraged to check the data before submission in GIS software, such as QGIS or Google Earth Pro. This reduces the need to go back and forth between the responsible KfW counterparts and the project staff.

### Approximate (admin unit) locations using Excel Template and GADM standard

Approximate (admin unit) project locations should be collected by referencing the respective administrative unit on the lowest administrative scale available in the GADM standard. GADM differentiates up to seven different levels, although for many developing countries, only three or four levels have yet been defined. Here are the most commonly available administrative unit levels:

-   level 0 (shape of the national boundary)

-   level 1 (region, province, governorate etc.)

-   level 2 (district, zone, department, municipality etc.)

-   level 3 (community, tehsil etc.)

In case your location is an administrative unit (=approximate (admin unit) in Column S "Geographic Exactness"), which is available in GADM, you may state its GADM GID (e.g. VNM.1.1.1_1 in Vietnam) the GID level (e.g. level 4) and GADM Version (e.g. 4.0.4) = VNM.1.1.1_L4_1_4.0.4 as "Project-specific location identifier" in Column G. If the respective administrative unit level has not been defined in GADM, you may instead indicate the GPS coordinates of the respective administrative unit center (municipality, district center or similar as a point location). In any case, you must specify the location as "approximate (admin unit)" in column No. S  ("Geographic Exactness") of the tab "fill-me" of the Excel template. This ensures that this location is not confused with the actual location of the site. 

The GIS database of GADM can be downloaded [here](https://gadm.org/data.html) and analyzed in a common GIS software such as QGIS, ArcGIS, or Google Earth Pro. Data collectors have to enter the GADM-defined polygon Geographic ID (GID), the GID level, and the utilized GADM database version. See Figure 2 below for more information:

### Can I also use other geospatial formats rather than KML?
We use Google Earth Pro to verify project location data submitted to our teams which works best with KML. If you are not able to provide data in KML, you might also use GPKG or GEOJSON. We encourage you not to use the Shapefile format since the world has suffered enough from it ;) .

### My KML file is too large to be sent via email. How can I send it to you? 
In this case you should ask your KfW project counterpart. They might provide you with a fileshare (idgard) or you might be able to use your own system of choice. 




## Tab "READ-ME General" in the Excel Template for General Information on how to fill out the Template

**Who should fill out this form?**

This Excel-Template is to be filled out by the Project Executing Agencies (PEAs) or Consultants, or other external Stakeholders tasked with the collection of project location data. 

**How should I fill out the Excel file?**

The excel file is thought to be self-explanatory to the user. If you click on the cells, small notes will pop up automatically that tell you if the field is to be filled mandatory or not (from a technical perspective), what data type is expected (text, numbers, dates, etc.) and a short explanation of the content that should be submitted. In addition, we recommend you read these FAQs in full and to attend one of our introductory sessions which will be also made available as recordings online.   


**What is a project location?**

A project location can consist of one or more features that are part of a financially supported activity where no further geographical discrimination regarding funding is possible. An example of a single-feature project location is a financially supported hospital in a specific location. An example of a project location with multiple features is a group of adjacent agricultural plots under a financed irrigation plan that benefits all producers in that area. Another example is a set of protected areas jointly financed from a fund if, and only if, further geographical discrimination as to the allocation of funds to specific areas is not possible. If discrimination is possible, data for multiple project locations (such as protected areas) and their financial allocation have to be collected. KfW highly encourages increasing geographical discrimination of financial flows to specific project locations to the maximum possible, as this affords greater aid transpaency and financial accountability.

**What is a Location Type?**

In our new location type list, you find the IATI location types that are useful for International Development plus additional location types for all sectors that were missing in the existing IATI-list. This allows aggregating across location types and assignment of respective icons for visualization / publication on a map. This template follows as closely as possible the International Aid Transparency Initiative IATI standard, but had to create additional location types, since those already existing in the IATI Standard would not allow us to cover all Financial Cooperation project types. We therefore created 197 new project location types, including “immaterial” ones like Capacity Development / Training or Voucher Schemes, that cannot be plotted according to any physical feature on a map, but can defined by the area covered by them. We therefore also adapted the definition of “location type” as “project output- or intervention-related type of physical location or immaterial output- or intervention area”.  See also list of Location Types in the Excel Template. Definitions for all IATI-based location types can be found [here](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/locationtype/). For details on how to fill out the template, please go to the table below, column O. 


**Geodata Types & reference system:**


This form allows you to collect single location points (e.g., one power plant site) or a larger number of project sites and features (e.g., 300 locations of buildings in different sectors within the framework of a decentralization project). In addition, project sites with larger areas and more complex geometries (e.g., polygons of forest protection areas) or linear location types like roads or railways are supported as well. All coordinates are to be collected using WGS 843 as the coordinate reference system. WGS 84 is the de-facto standard for web mapping applications. Geo-coordinates are to be provided in the decimal place format 00.00000 in the order LAT,LONG (using at least 5 digits after the separator).


**Mandatory and Non-Mandatory Fields:**


The data to be collected are subject to minimum requirements in the form of mandatory fields, and there are non-mandatory fields that can be used for collecting additional site-specific information. Please agree with KfW and your other main project partners which non-mandatory fields to fill within the respective project, if this has not yet been specified in the geodata collection ToR > Annex 3.2.

**DAC 5 Purpose Classification/CRS-Code:**

The DAC 5 Purpose Codes (one to four) for the entire project have to be provided by your KfW counterpart (ideally in the geodata collection ToR, see Annex 3.2). 

In case there are more than one codes for the project, you have to assign the correct code to each location. In case your project contains locations contributing not only to one, but two, three or four DAC/CRS-Codes, please create two, three or four separate rows with the same GPS-Coordinates, but different DAC/CRS-Codes, and potentially different location types and activity descriptions.

In case all codes have to be assigned to all locations, then please create a new row for each location, with the only difference being the DAC 5 Purpose Classification. For the complete list of codes, see table sheet "DAC Purpose Codes" of the Excel Template. 

**Budget Share:** 

The budget share allocated to this location in €. The sum of all locations in a project should add up to the budget sum in Inpro/PMT including overheads. Data from private partners/PEA must not be entered here! If the budget shares of all locations are to be provided, the budget sum will be provided by the KfW counterpart in the geodata collection ToR > Annex 3.2.

**Exact vs. Approximate locations:**

In case you already know your exact location coordinates, you may state them as “exact” locations. In case you don’t know (yet) your exact locations, or you only need to define administrative units (e.g. one entire country for a Policy-Based-Lending project, or a number of districts in a country for a decentralization project) or if you cannot communicate exact coordinates due to security restrictions in a conflict zone, you may state them as “approximate”. In case your location is an administrative unit (=approximate (admin unit) in Column S "Geographic Exactness"), which is available in GADM, you may state its GADM GID (e.g. VNM.1.1.1_1 in Vietnam) the GID level (e.g. level 4) and GADM Version (e.g. 4.0.4) = VNM.1.1.1_L4_1_4.0.4 as "Project-specific location identifier" in Column G.


**How to provide lines and polygons?**

If your location does not represent a single point location, please provide additional geoinformation in the KML format, e.g. for lines or polygons (e.g. in the case your location covers a forest area or an administrative unit like a district as a whole). In the section ‘Location data’, under ‘Latitude’ and ‘Longitude’, fill in the coordinates of the locations centroid. Provide the information of the additional columns in this section. For each row entry with additional geolocation, indicate the filename of the KML file in which the associated geometry is stored.  The column `Primary Key` is used to associate an activity described in the excel sheet with its corresponding geolocation. It is very important this field is filled correctly. For each distinct location the primary key is equivalent both in the excel sheet and the associated KML file. Use whole numbers (integers) to construct the primary key. Similar to point locations, make sure that the geoinformation is delivered in unprojected coordinates on the WGS84 reference ellipsoid in the order LAT,LONG ("EPSG:4326").

**Privacy, confidentiality and publication:**


The Excel Template should be submitted without containing any personal data or any data that could be linked to individual persons, such as houses of private households. Please note, that KfW does not publish any exact coordinates of its project locations. Location data collection in fragile and conflict contexts should be treated with extra diligence.

### How to compare project location data from existing systems (R/MIS, GIS)?

If a Geographic Information System (GIS), (Remote) Management Information System (R/MIS) or Maintenance Management System (MMS) or a public database such as GADM is used in the project, then the existing location IDs can also be entered in the Excel template as Project-Specific Location Identifiers (No. G in the table below), as defined in the Excel/Kobo template. This makes it easier to check location data across project partner systems and verify the use of funds.

## The KfW Project Location Data Collection Model for Financial Cooperation

Below, the required project location data is defined for all FC projects. Project-related data is usually provided from both internal and external sources. The external data (see column "Source" with field entry "Input") has to be provided by the Project Executing Agency or consultant staff using the geodata collection ToR and the template(s) provided by KfW and be validated by the responsible KfW counterpart before uploading.

#### Table 2: The KfW Project Location Data Collection Model for Financial Cooperation

| **Name** | **Type of data** | **Source**      |  **Mandatory**  | **Assignment** | **Description** | 
| ---------|:----------------:| ---------------:| ---------------:| --------------:| --------------:|

| B. KfW project No. (INPRO) | Number | Input  |Yes| Per location | Every project location in the FC Geodata Model must be assigned to its respective KfW project number that is being provided by KfW in the geodata collection ToR > Annex 3.2 |
| C. Abbreviation of project name (project acronym) | Text    | Input | No | Per location | Please enter here the acronym used for the name/title of the project (e.g. HREII) to be visible on your map. If the project has multiple phases, please add the number of the phase belonging to the before-stated KfW Project-No. |
| D. Data Owner (Institution Name) |Text | Input |Yes| Per location | Legal Entity who owns the data provided here (= legal authorship) |
| E. Publishing restrictions due to security reasons | Select Text (yes/no) | Input | Yes  | Per location | Indicates if this information is collected in fragile regions (e.g. areas of severe civil conflict or war) and should therefore be ommited from publicly available reports.In fragile contexts, geolocation information must be protected and may not be published, for example in online maps, public ESIA or evaluation reports for security reasons (e.g., risk of conflict, repression/discrimination or terrorist attack) in the target area(s) |
| F. Date of data collection or latest update   | Date YYYY-MM-DD (Date format - English/US) | Input |No| Per location | Date of data collection or latest update (if date of data collection is unknown). In case only the year is available please choose the 1st of january e.g. 2022-01-01 |
| G. Project-specific location identifier  | Text    | Selection |No| Per location | In case the location or activity has a project-specific identifier (e.g., a location code in the MIS of the source Agency, e.g. Project Executing Agency(PEA)) or an identifier in a public database like GADM,  it can be entered here. This enables logically connecting and comparing the location/activity in the KfW–system against the location/activity in the Agency/PEA-system. In case your location is an administrative unit (=approximate (admin unit) in Column S "Geographic Exactness"), which is available in GADM, you may state its GADM GID (e.g. VNM.1.1.1_1 in Vietnam) the GID level (e.g. level 4) and GADM Version (e.g. 4.0.4) = VNM.1.1.1_L4_1_4.0.4 as "Project-specific location identifier" in Column G. Otherwise the identifier is the Unique ID in Column A of this table. |
| H. Location name |Text | Input |Yes| Per location | Short name of the project site ideally containing a summary of the main project activity and the location name (max. 40 characters or digits) |
| I. Location activity status  | Select Text  | Input  | No | Per location | The location activity status according to the IATI standard. If you are unaware of the current status please choose "NA". Updates are only mandatory annually at the time of annual reporting for the respective funding client, as too many updates could otherwise be required depending on the project type. We recommend more frequent regular updating however for your own project monitoring |
| J. Planned or actual start date of activity at the location   | Date  YYYY-MM-DD (Date format - English/US) | Input | Yes | Per location | Aprox. planned or actual start date of implementation of activities on the ground. This can be e.g. the date when construction work is planned to begin. For no information enter 2100-01-01. Ideally, the start of project implementation is defined in the geodata collection ToR > Annex 3.2 |
| K. Planned or actual end date of activity at the location   | Date  YYYY-MM-DD (Date format - English/US) | Input | Yes | Per location | Aprox. planned or actual end date of activities on the ground.

| N. KC Theme / Sub-Sector | Select Text |  Selection | Yes | Per location | Sectoral / cross-sectoral location type preselection field, see table sheets "Location Types" & KC Themes. If there is no fit,  select "other physical or other immaterial and fill out the column "Alternative Location Type". Please note, that this field only serves to help you find the correct location type name, not for assigning the correct subsector (the latter is done thourgh selecting the correct DAC/CRS-Code in column Q. |
| O. Location Type Name | Select Text   | Selection  | Yes | Per location | After selecting the KC Theme/Sub-Sector, choose the most appropriate location type, see table sheet "Location Types". If there is no fit, please select "other physical" or "other immaterial" and fill out the next column "Alternative Location Type". In case you need/want to mention two different location types (e.g. school and capacity development) at the same GPS-Coordinate, you may just create two separate two rows for these locations types with the respectively different activity descriptions, DAC/CRS-Codes at the same GPS coordinates.  |
| P. Alternative Location Type Name  | Text  | Input  | No | Per location | If you selected "other physical or other immaterial " in the column "Location Type Name", please propose your own location type name. This promotes systemic learning, allows us to identify additionally required location types and will help us to propose a comprehensive IATI standard extension in the future. |
| Q. DAC 5 Purpose Classification /CRS-Code   |Text | Input | Yes | Per location | The DAC 5 Purpose Codes (one to four) for the entire project have to be provided by your KfW counterpart (ideally in the ToR, see Annex 3.2). In case your project contains locations contributing not only to one, but two, three or four DAC/CRS-Codes, please create two, three or four separate rows with the same GPS-Coordinates, but different DAC/CRS-Codes, and potentially different location types and activity descriptions. In case all codes have to be assigned to all locations, then please create a new row for each location, with the only difference being the DAC 5 Purpose Classification. 
| R. Budget share | Currency number in EUR  | Input  | No | Per location | The budget share allocated to this location in €. The sum of all locations in a project should add up to the budget sum in Inpro/PMT including overheads. Data from private partners/PEA must not be entered here! If the budget shares of all locations are to be provided, the budget sum will be provided by the KfW counterpart in the geodata collection ToR > Annex 3.2 |
| S. Geographic exactness | Select Text |   Input | Yes | Per location | The “exact” specification is to be used when the coder is confident of coding the exact geographically end destination of a financial flow. In case you already know your exact location coordinates, you may state them as “exact” locations. Flows that can only be traced to a general area or an approximate location are to be coded as “approximate. In case you don’t know (yet) your exact locations (=approximate (yet unknown)), or you only need to define administrative units (e.g. one entire country for a Policy-Based-Lending project, or a number of districts in a country for a decentralization project) (=approximate (admin unit)) or if you cannot communicate exact coordinates due to security restrictions in a conflict zone (=approximate (security)), you may state them respectively as “approximate”.  In case of security risks (e.g., zones of conflict), we strongly recommend only publishing approximate locations! |
| T. Latitude | Decimal Number  | Input  | Yes | Per location | Enter the Latitude measured with a GPS device (or centroid for approximate locations). Make sure to use WGS 84 as the Coordinate Reference System (EPSG:4326). Enter Values with at least FIVE digits. Example: 50.12018514689011. |
| U. Longitude | Decimal Number  | Input  | Yes | Per location | Enter the Longitude measured with a GPS device (or centroid for approximate locations) here. Make sure to use WGS 84 as the Coordinate Reference System (EPSG:4326). Enter Values with at least FIVE digits. Example: 8.655474047059236  |
| V. Related Community / Village / Neighborhood | Decimal Number  | Input  | No | Per location | You may enter a village, hamlet or neighborhood name that relates to this location. This can serve to manually add smaller community resp. administrative unit names not identified in global coordinates lists such as GADM. |
| W. Filename of additional Geo-data submitted as KML (Lines/Polygons) | Text  | Input  | Yes, if kmldata is provided | Per location | A string of the KML file where the associated geometry information is found. If your location does not represent a single point location, please provide additional geoinformation in the KML format (e.g. in the case your location covers a forest area or an administrative unit like a district as a whole). In the section ‘Location data’, under ‘Latitude’ and ‘Longitude’, fill in the coordinates of the locations centroid. Provide the information of the additional columns in this section. For each row entry with additional geolocation, indicate the filename of the KML file in which the associated geometry is stored. Note, to link an entry from this excel to the KML file, it is required to correctly fill in the Primary Key column X.  |
| X. Primary Key (as provided in KML file) | Decimal Number  | Input  | Yes, if kmldata is provided | Per location | Required only in case you provide additonal geolocation information in another KML file. The geometry in the KML file should possess the same primary key as an attribute as it is listed here.|
